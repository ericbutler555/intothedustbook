        <strong>Saturday, August 29, seven days until the Man burns</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Diane opened her eyes to the noise of the wind lightly blowing and surging against the carport. There was light enough to see outside her tent. The camp sounded quiet. Sitting up and stretching, she could feel some tightness in her muscles from the unfamiliar work.</p>
      <p>Trying to be quiet, she slid out of her sleeping bag and blinked away the sleep in her eyes. Slipping on her clothing from the day before, she started the single-burner stove on the table. With the flame caressing the bottom of the coffee percolator on low, Diane put on her shoes and gathered her shemagh and goggles.</p>
      <p>The shower had been glorious, the quick wash and rinse both invigorating and restorative. The night air had been somewhat chilly, though. She reminded herself to shower before sunset next time. The brief period between being clean and then shortly after coated with the ever-present dust would take some getting used to.</p>
      <p>Leaving the carport, Diane could see no one moving yet in camp. As she walked to the porta-potties, she breathed in the morning air. It was cool enough to be comfortable but not too chilly. Finishing her morning ablutions and snagging a cup of the ready coffee, Diane climbed the ladder to the top of the storage container and sat in a chair.</p>
      <p>Sipping the coffee, Diane looked out on the lightening sky, the dust haze red in the dawn. She smiled. The morning had long been a time to herself, a time to focus and prepare for whatever the day might present. Some people in other camps, early risers as well, were beginning to stir.</p>
      <p>As she sat there, she slipped out her phone and tried to log into her work email. She had not been out of touch with her office for so long in years. She felt guilty logging in now, but she was compelled to at least get a sense of what was going on. Her email was not logging on, though. Each entry resulted in an access-denied message.</p>
      <p>Switching to texts, she saw that her team had at first been frantic but had then seemingly calmed. Stella must have told them Diane was fine and to carry on. Diane also saw a text from Stella informing her that her access had been cut off until her return.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Busted,&rdquo; a voice said, directly behind her.</p>
      <p>Diane sat up, startled. Jeremy was standing there looking at her phone.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t hear anything,&rdquo; Diane said. &ldquo;How did you do that?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I can be quiet sometimes,&rdquo; Jeremy replied, looking at her. &ldquo;Sorry if I scared you. Checking into the world?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; Diane replied sheepishly.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to let go. I&rsquo;m guilty of it too.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Hmmm,&rdquo; Diane replied. Then, noticing how he was dressed, she asked, &ldquo;Headed out?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Thought I might before it gets too hot. Want to come?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s camp. He texted me last night, said he&rsquo;d arrived.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Let me grab my stuff,&rdquo; Diane replied.</p>
      <p>Jeremy went down the ladder, then held it. Ducking into the carport, Diane grabbed the essentials, happy to have staged the equipment in one place. After jotting a brief note to TK on the small whiteboard by the door, she grabbed her bike and joined Jeremy on the road. The street was peaceful, the pace slow and easy.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t your brother camping with you?&rdquo; Diane asked as they rode.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;He is camping with his rugby club, a group from New Zealand,&rdquo; Jeremy replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a small camp, so I couldn&rsquo;t get a ticket through them. But I could go through Dead Presidents.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Makes sense,&rdquo; Diane said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Street K. Now we turn,&rdquo; Jeremy said. &ldquo;Is it Saturday already? I&rsquo;m losing track.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yeah, I think so,&rdquo; Diane replied. &ldquo;TK said the Gate opens tonight at midnight, so the Burn only gets bigger from here.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I think this is it,&rdquo; Jeremy said, stopping in front of a dusty plot. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my brother&rsquo;s truck.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>They locked their bikes and looked around the half-built camp.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s too early?&rdquo; Diane asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;No, not for Ollie.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>As they wound their way through the equipment and piles of items, a tarp suddenly lifted from the ground and a man erupted, moving fast. Diane froze, surprised. Jeremy smoothly pivoted, grabbed the man&rsquo;s arm, and put him to the ground.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Diane, meet Ollie,&rdquo; Jeremy said as he held the man&rsquo;s arm straight up with a firm hold on his wrist.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Ow, leave off!&rdquo; Ollie said.</p>
      <p>Jeremy released his arm and squatted beside him.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You good?&rdquo; Jeremy asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t bruise steel,&rdquo; Ollie replied, scrambling to his feet. &ldquo;How have you been?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Jeremy replied, shaking Ollie&rsquo;s hand.</p>
      <p>Diane could see the resemblance in the men&rsquo;s faces, even though Ollie had four inches and thirty pounds of muscle on Jeremy. Still, Jeremy had controlled Ollie much more easily than Diane would have expected. There was more to him than met the eye.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You guys eat?&rdquo; Ollie asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Jeremy said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Well, come on, then,&rdquo; Ollie replied.</p>
      <p>Diane and Jeremy followed him to a large green army tent and then inside. As her eyes adapted to the gloom, Diane saw five large men and two women eating and drinking coffee.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Tane!&rdquo; Ollie thundered. &ldquo;This is my brother Jeremy and&hellip; Diane, is it?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>A huge and muscular man rose from the table and walked over to Jeremy. His face was covered in black tribal tattoos. His imposing appearance was offset by the kindness in his eyes.</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<em>Tena koe</em>, Jeremy, if you are the brother of this one,&rdquo; Tane said. &ldquo;Welcome. Do you know the <em>hongi</em>?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>The man towered over Jeremy, but Diane could see that he was relaxed, for all his fierceness. Diane had never seen anyone like him in her life.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t believe I do,&rdquo; Jeremy replied.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Let me show you, if you consent. It is the traditional Māori greeting.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Jeremy nodded.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I place my hand on your shoulder,&rdquo; Tane said, doing so, &ldquo;and then we touch foreheads and noses. We share the breath of life.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Tane leaned down and touched foreheads with Jeremy.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Welcome home,&rdquo; Tane said, then looked to Diane. &ldquo;And yourself, Diane?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yes, please.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane stepped closer to Tane, who placed his forehead gently against hers, their noses touching briefly. In this manner, she and Jeremy were introduced to the rest of the people. All of them except for Ollie were Māori.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Our first victims—er, students,&rdquo; a pretty woman named Ahora said. Unlike the men, she had an intricate tattoo only on her chin.</p>
      <p>Jeremy looked quizzically at Ollie, who laughed.</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They want to introduce Māori culture in the Burn. One way is by doing the <em>haka</em> and teaching it,&rdquo; Ollie said.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a <em>haka</em>?&rdquo; Jeremy inquired.
      </p>
      <p>&ldquo;Funny you should ask,&rdquo; Tane said, smiling and gesturing them outside.</p>
      <p>Diane and Jeremy went out of the tent, then turned to see the people they had just met lined up like bowling pins, facing them.</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t get scared,&rdquo; Tane said. &ldquo;The <em>haka</em> is a traditional Māori ceremonial dance or challenge. It is also a symbol of community and strength. We bring it here to teach and include others. And now&hellip; the Ka Mate, written by Te Rauparaha.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>Diane watched as Tane began chanting. Others in the group struck fierce poses, their faces twisted, their tongues sticking out.</p>
      <p>
        <em>&ldquo;Ka mate, ka mate! Ka ora! Ka ora!&rdquo;</em> Tane and the others chanted as they struck poses and slapped their thighs.
      </p>
      <p>The performance was over quickly.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;That was powerful!&rdquo; Diane said, clapping.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Would you like to learn it?&rdquo; Ahora asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yes, absolutely,&rdquo; Diane replied. &ldquo;Is it okay if I do it?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Tane said. &ldquo;If you are interested, come to our classes. We have a lot of history to share. There are even <em>hakas</em> that are just for women. We plan on having the classes, then doing a <em>haka</em> in the evening. Stop by if you can.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeremy and Diane stayed at the camp for a bit, learning more about the <em>haka</em>. They both had fun. Ahora showed Diane how to put her face into a fierce scowl until they were all laughing. Other people had started to drift over and be introduced to the ceremony.
      </p>
      <p>&ldquo;We should probably head back to camp to finish setup,&rdquo; Jeremy said.</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you for coming, my friends,&rdquo; Tane said. &ldquo;Take a piece of bread. It is our <em>rēwena</em> bread, made from potatoes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>Diane and Jeremy exchanged hugs with each camp member, and each took a slice of the offered bread. It was tasty and sweet.</p>
      <p>
        <em>&ldquo;Mihi mo inaianei,&rdquo;</em> Ahora said. &ldquo;Goodbye, my friends.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>&ldquo;Come again soon,&rdquo; Ollie said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Come to our bar tonight,&rdquo; Jeremy shouted back. &ldquo;We are right down the road.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Bet on it,&rdquo; Ollie replied.</p>
      <p>Jeremy and Diane headed back to camp on their bicycles.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Jeremy said. &ldquo;That was fun!&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Best morning ever,&rdquo; Diane said.</p>
      <p>In camp, most people were now up and about. After parking her bike and locking it, Diane joined the others under the bar canopy. She found a seat next to TK and sat down.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Good time?&rdquo; TK asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Best morning,&rdquo; Diane replied.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Alright people, here&rsquo;s the plan,&rdquo; Twinkle said. &ldquo;Get up the yoga tent and light garden, finalize the bar decorations. And then camp chores. All Virgins with Steven to learn the camp chores, the rest with TK and Sequoia.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>At that moment, a large RV pulled into the area in front of the bar, blaring its air horn. The sound of air brakes setting was followed by the opening of the door. A small, lean, muscular woman with dark blue hair stepped out. She was wearing knee-high red leather boots with buckles, bright red booty shorts, and a tight baby doll T-shirt with BITCH bedazzled on it, baring a defined six-pack. Large Jackie O sunglasses set off a gorgeous face.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Who do you have to fuck to get a drink around here?&rdquo; the woman loudly demanded of the group.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Sheba!&rdquo; TK and Sequoia said together and ran to the woman.</p>
      <p>Sheba reached up, grabbed Sequoia&rsquo;s hair in one hand, and laid a huge kiss on him. She then stepped into TK and dipped her as she gave her a deep kiss on the mouth. They were all laughing as they walked over to the bar, Sheba stopping to give three people deep kisses and hugs.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Sheba,&rdquo; TK said, leading the woman over, &ldquo;this is Diane, my friend and Virgin.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Sheba looked Diane up and down and stepped forward with her arms raised.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Consent, Diane?&rdquo; Sheba asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Diane said.</p>
      <p>Sheba leaned in, taking Diane into her arms, and laid a deep kiss on her mouth. Diane was surprised, and her eyes widened. She could feel the kiss from the bottom of her toes to the top of her head.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Mwah,&rdquo; Sheba said, pulling away. &ldquo;Good kisser. Which team do you play for? Or are you a switch-hitter?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Wh-what?&rdquo; Diane could feel herself blushing to the roots of her hair.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Just trying to plan my week,&rdquo; Sheba said, looking over to Jeremy. &ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Jeremy, Twinkle&rsquo;s Virgin,&rdquo; Sequoia said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;He spoken for?&rdquo; Sheba asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; TK said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Excuse me, then. Momma&rsquo;s got a need,&rdquo; Sheba said, then strode over to Jeremy.</p>
      <p>Diane watched Sheba&rsquo;s stride. She was poetry in leather boots, confidence personified. Sheba struck a pose with her hand on her hip as she talked to Jeremy. Diane watched as she leaned in and kissed the young man, and then the two of them walked to Sheba&rsquo;s RV and through the door. A young man and woman came out of the RV, then the door closed.</p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Holy hell,&rdquo; Diane said in wonder at the scene, adding, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect <em>that</em> when I gave consent.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>TK and Sequoia laughed at her.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yeah, it&rsquo;s best to clarify sometimes,&rdquo; TK said. &ldquo;Sheba is Sheba.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane watched as Sheba&rsquo;s RV started slowly rocking.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Diane said. &ldquo;Is that what I&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Sheba,&rdquo; TK said. &ldquo;Living in the moment.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t bother knocking on the door,&rdquo; Sequoia said.</p>
      <p>Diane smiled despite herself. She walked over to where Steven was standing at the bar.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; Diane said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;We will give Jeremy a bit,&rdquo; Steven replied. &ldquo;Have a seat.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane finished her cup of coffee. In time, the door to the RV opened and Jeremy and Sheba emerged. Sheba grabbed Jeremy&rsquo;s head and kissed him, then pointed to the RV and then toward camp. Jeremy climbed back into the RV and closed the door, firing it up. Sheba strode purposefully toward the bar.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Steven,&rdquo; Sheba said, pulling out a long black holder and putting a cigarette in the end. Steven placed a glass in front of Sheba on the bar, splashed some whiskey into it, then held a lighter for her. Sheba downed the whiskey and leaned into the proffered fire.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a peach,&rdquo; Sheba said to Steven, then strode away.</p>
      <p>Diane watched her approach the area for the yoga tent and start barking orders. Jeremy walked into the bar with a silly grin on his face.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Ready to work?&rdquo; Steven asked. &ldquo;Or do you need a rest?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s get after it,&rdquo; Steven said.</p>
      <p>Diane watched Jeremy, bemused. The quiet young man seemed somewhat lighter in energy.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Fun morning?&rdquo; Diane asked teasingly.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s shaping up well,&rdquo; Jeremy replied, smiling.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not over yet,&rdquo; Steven said. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s grab these shower bags and fill them.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The three got to work. Steven showed them how to fill shower bags, fuel up and start the generators, and spread the water around with the brushes in the evap pond so it would dissipate quickly. The three then did a MOOP sweep through the camp, collecting small bits of trash and debris. Walking slowly through camp, Diane picked up splinters of wood, sequins, and a cigarette butt.</p>
      <p>They moved the burn barrel, a fifty-five-gallon steel drum with artistic figures and designs cut into its sides, to a spot near the front of the camp. By the time they were done, the rest of the campers had gotten the large tent structure for yoga up.</p>
      <p>Directed by Steven, Diane and Jeremy moved on to driving thick, long steel rebar stakes into the ground, leaving about two feet of each sticking up. They then slipped long PVC pipes over the rebar, with tall, colorful flags that slid over the full length of the pipes. These marked the edges of their plot of land. The bold colors of the flags brightened up the drab landscape. The wind was increasing as they finished, enough to start to bend the PVC poles.</p>
      <p>Diane got her goggles and mask and continued moving from job to job, lending a hand where needed. Her body was tired, her hands aching from the unfamiliar manual labor, but she ignored it and pressed on. The city was rising around her. Despite the physical strain, she felt a part of something greater than herself, a group working toward a goal.</p>
      <p>A large, metal-barred geodesic dome went up in a complicated manner after a couple of tries. People were on ladders as well as standing in place supporting the various bars. TK was on Sequoia&rsquo;s shoulders, tightening bolts and swearing and laughing until the whole thing was accomplished. The light was starting to fade in the sky, and the strong wind had died off again.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Ice, who needs ice?&rdquo; Twinkle said to the group. &ldquo;Arctica is open for a short window. Get your money and talk to TK.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Diane,&rdquo; TK said, coming over to her, &ldquo;you want to go on an ice run?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Diane replied. &ldquo;What do we need to do?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Get a list of orders and money, I&rsquo;ll get the ice bike. Grab your stuff and meet me in the bar,&rdquo; TK said, then handed her a small, zippered bag. &ldquo;Put the money in here.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane got her equipment and a pad of paper from the carport. People were waiting in the bar when she got back. She wrote down orders for bags and blocks of ice and put the money in the zippered bag as directed. TK pulled up on a cruiser bike covered in fur, with a small cart attached behind.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; TK said, pulling off on the bike.</p>
      <p>Diane scrambled, putting the money and notebook into her bag, then unlocked her bike and set off. TK was meandering slowly, waiting for her, and she had no trouble catching up.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little way, no need to rush,&rdquo; said TK, waving at people in a camp they were passing.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;So, Sheba,&rdquo; Diane began. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that about?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Jealous?&rdquo; TK teased.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone just grab someone and go off like that,&rdquo; Diane replied.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be judgy,&rdquo; TK said. &ldquo;You have your eye on Jeremy?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I—I—&rdquo; Diane stammered.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be embarrassed. He&rsquo;s cute and seems nice.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;What about Sheba?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Sheba won&rsquo;t sleep with him again. That&rsquo;s her MO. She just lives in the moment,&rdquo; TK said. &ldquo;More than anyone I have met.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Diane replied.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Probably not, but you might. Sheba is great people and very, very moral. Hers are just different morals than most other people live by. There&rsquo;s no gray area with Sheba, it is all radical honesty.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Eleventh principle?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s entitlement,&rdquo; TK replied.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I thought it was consent,&rdquo; Diane said. &ldquo;There was one thing I was curious about.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; TK replied.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, but it made me feel awkward. Didn&rsquo;t know if I had done something wrong.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; TK said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I met Steven with Jeremy,&rdquo; Diane said. &ldquo;He greeted Jeremy and hugged him. I expected a hug and told him I hug too, but he just said ‘Cool&rsquo; and didn&rsquo;t hug me. God, I feel stupid just saying it. Is that entitlement? Did I feel entitled to a hug?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>TK laughed. &ldquo;No. Just about everyone hugs here, it&rsquo;s a Burner thing. Steven wasn&rsquo;t being rude. He is a Mormon, and he was married for a long time, then his wife died. His belief structure is that he is married to her forever, in this life and the next. He is very cautious about connections to women he doesn&rsquo;t know. We talked about it a long time at the bar one night.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;That makes sense now,&rdquo; Diane said. &ldquo;I thought Mormons didn&rsquo;t drink.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t, just bartends,&rdquo; TK replied. &ldquo;Here we are.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane followed her, pulling up near a tall dome covered in heavy tan material. Parking their bikes and locking them, they walked to the end of the long line.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;This is not bad. Later in the day and into the week, it can be hours,&rdquo; TK said.</p>
      <p>They watched and chatted with the other people in line. Moving along at a moderate pace, they neared the entrance.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Diane, over there,&rdquo; TK said, pointing. &ldquo;You see those two people in khaki? With the radios and hats? Those are Rangers.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Kinda look official, like cops or something,&rdquo; Diane said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;No, they are Dirt Rangers. They are just Burners like us,&rdquo; TK said. &ldquo;See the deputy sheriff and Bureau of Land Management trucks with lights? Those are cops. The Rangers are who you go to first if you have conflicts or problems. That way the cops don&rsquo;t have to deal with it and do cop stuff.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; Diane said. &ldquo;Am I a Burner now?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You always were, you just didn&rsquo;t know it,&rdquo; TK said. &ldquo;Whoot, whoot! Thank you, Rangers!&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The Rangers waved back. Suddenly the whole line was calling out, &ldquo;Thank you, Rangers! Thank you, Rangers!&rdquo;</p>
      <p>The Rangers laughed and waved and continued on their way. TK and Diane went into Arctica for their turn and purchased their ice order. Loading into the bike cart was accomplished, and they headed back. The heat had certainly increased. Diane was very aware of the sun.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Man,&rdquo; Diane said as she pedaled. &ldquo;I should have brought my sun hat.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yeah, you start to notice the heat this time of day,&rdquo; TK replied. &ldquo;Look there, that&rsquo;s cool.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Diane asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Look at the dust devil. Behind the girl in front of us.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane looked ahead. There was what looked like a tiny tornado, about six feet tall, slowly moving behind a girl on a bicycle, perfectly matching her pace. Diane continued to watch as the girl took a right at the next street. The dust devil turned as well and followed behind her.</p>
      <p>TK and Diane both stopped and gaped, then looked around to see if someone else had witnessed this. A man standing by the road turned and met their gazes.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Did you guys see that too?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; TK said. &ldquo;Kinda trippy.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Playa magic,&rdquo; he said. He tossed them a casual wave, then turned back into his camp.</p>
      <p>Continuing on, the women were back at their camp in no time. Diane helped unload the ice, enjoying the cold of it against her body after the hot ride in the sun.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You still feeling the heat?&rdquo; TK asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess I still have to acclimate a little,&rdquo; Diane admitted.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I got this. Give me a hand with the ice and I&rsquo;ll teach you something,&rdquo; TK said, hoisting two bags.</p>
      <p>Diane lifted the remaining bags and followed her friend. When she entered the carport, TK had set out two of the plastic buckets on the floor.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Grab the other handle of the cooler,&rdquo; TK said. &ldquo;Lift the whole thing onto the one bucket in the center, with the spout over the other.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane did as she was asked and watched as TK opened the spout of the cooler. The water splashed and filled the bucket until there was only a trickle. TK closed the spout, and they lifted the cooler back into place. After filling the cooler with fresh ice, TK pulled out a jug of vinegar and poured a measure into the water. She then grabbed a couple of beers and took the bucket by the handle.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; TK said, walking out and into the bar and finding a seat there. Curious, Diane followed her and pulled up a seat next to her.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Now take off your shoes and socks and slide your feet in there,&rdquo; TK said.</p>
      <p>Diane did as instructed. She flinched. The water was icy cold. But she could feel her body temp cooling off as she put first one foot, then the other, into the water.</p>
      <p>TK handed her a beer. Diane cracked it and took a sip.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Ahhh, that&rsquo;s nice,&rdquo; Diane said, relaxing into her chair.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good way to cool off. And the vinegar will help your skin,&rdquo; TK replied.</p>
      <p>They spent the rest of the afternoon siesta there in the shade of the bar. Diane met and chatted with other campers, found out about their past Burns and experiences. The afternoon was too hot for exploring, the wind was gusty, and the camp was all but built, so there was plenty of time for friendly conversation, and the laughter was a welcome respite. Diane drifted off after a few beers and whiskeys. She awoke to the sound of music playing. People were sitting at the bar.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Hi, sleepyhead,&rdquo; Twinkle said. &ldquo;You have a good nap?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I guess I did,&rdquo; Diane said, sitting up. The sun had dropped, and the temperature seemed cooler. She took her feet out of the bucket. Her toes had wrinkled. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to fall asleep. I wanted to help.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about it. We have enough people finishing up now. Since you&rsquo;re a Virgin, I wanted to make sure you didn&rsquo;t overwork. I would have let you sleep, but I thought you might want a shower with warmer water before the dusk hits. It can get a little chilly when the sun goes down.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;What do I do with this vinegar water?&rdquo; Diane asked. &ldquo;Pour it in the evap pond?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; TK said. &ldquo;That just adds more water to evaporate. Pour it into the flower watering can over there and spread it on the road. Keeps the dust down.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane did so.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Shower now?&rdquo; TK asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;A shower sounds fantastic,&rdquo; Diane replied.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Well, grab a bag and take your turn.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane could see a camper finishing up their shower and went to gather her own things. Standing on the plastic pallet, letting the water moisten her, then soaping up, felt spectacular. The water was warm enough to be comfortable. Diane took her time scrubbing and lathering, wanting to get as clean as possible.</p>
      <p>As she walked back to the carport, the wind felt glorious on her clean skin. The gossamer fabric of the wrap she wore caressed her in the light breeze. She could see the light fading as sunset approached. Hurriedly, she stowed her toiletries, threw on some clothing, and scrambled to the top of the container to watch the sunset. Her steps on the ladder were more confident now. TK, already there, slipped an arm around her waist and hugged her close.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s only been three days,&rdquo; Diane said as she looked out at the camps being built. The spaces were filling up.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It just gets bigger and bigger from here,&rdquo; TK replied. &ldquo;You feeling up to going out after this?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yeah. What do you have in mind?&rdquo; Diane replied.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Steven is headed out to his friend&rsquo;s art installation after we eat,&rdquo; TK said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Sounds great.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>They saw the sun touching the mountains, heard the howling, and joined in.</p>
