      <h2>CHAPTER 10</h2>
      <p style={{ textIndent: "0" }}><strong>The man’s back and shoulders were straining.</strong> Dust was in the creases of his muscles, accenting them. Long hair, dark, curly, and tied with a cord, fell almost to his waist. A dusty black kilt held up with a wide leather belt rode low on his narrow hips. His torso was a V shape, climbing to his broad shoulders. Thick, muscular calves disappeared into worn black leather boots.</p>
      <p>All of this Diane took in as she rode up to the towering art piece illuminated by construction lights. The man turned and looked at Steven, then at Diane. His stern, serious face, intimidating, tanned and rugged, lit up, the thick black beard split by white teeth. His eyes, smoldering green, shone with pleasure. They landed on Diane and held her gaze, and she was lost in them.</p>
      <p>“Malcolm,” Steven said. “How are you, my friend?”</p>
      <p>The two men hugged, loudly clapping each other on the back. TK stopped beside Diane with Sequoia. Diane was trying to tear her eyes from the dusty god in front of her. Sequoia was off his bike, leaning back to take in the massive structure of pipes and shapes. TK reached out and touched Diane’s chin, gently closing her mouth.</p>
      <p>“I wonder what this is gonna look like working,” Sequoia said.</p>
      <p>“I wonder what his thighs taste like, hmmm, Diane?” TK said softly so that only Diane could hear. Diane blushed furiously and took a drink of her water instead of speaking. She was grateful for the shadows, confident that her face was scarlet.</p>
      <p>Steven brought Malcolm and his team over to the group and introduced them. Hugs were given all around. Hugging Malcolm, Diane inhaled his scent of masculinity and physical effort and was intoxicated.</p>
      <p>“What are you building?” Jeremy asked.</p>
      <p>“Hearts of Fire,” Malcolm replied. “Two eighteen-foot metal sculptures, a woman and a man experiencing passion. Flames come out from their chests so that they launch fire at each other, igniting the rose of love between them.”</p>
      <p>“Here, you guys, I brought you food,” Steven said, pulling covered trays and water from his bike cart.</p>
      <p>“Thanks, buddy,” Malcolm said. “I’m famished.”</p>
      <p>“How long have you been building this?” TK asked as the team started eating.</p>
      <p>“Four days straight so far,” Malcolm said after swallowing. “We sleep where we drop. The sculptures are in place, we are doing final checks on our connections, the inspection is in a bit. We look like we are going to make our deadline for our art grant.”</p>
      <p>“This is a grant project for the Burning Man Organization?” Sequoia asked.</p>
      <p>“Yeah,” Malcolm replied. “They have a deadline. If you don’t make it, then you don’t get the grant.”</p>
      <p>Diane stepped back, taking in the structure. There were a couple of bright construction lights on the site. The figures made sense, a man and a woman facing each other. Crudely human yet sensuous shapes, made of twisted steel, towering above the crowd. Stainless steel ovals were centered in their chests.</p>
      <p>She had never seen anything like it.</p>
      <p>“We were about to test it,” Malcolm said. “Want to watch?”</p>
      <p>“Hell, yeah,” TK said.</p>
      <p>“Alright. Dougie, we good to go?” Malcolm asked a dusty man by the control console.</p>
      <p>A thumbs-up from the man and Malcolm nodded.</p>
      <p>“Alright, with you guys here we have enough for a safety cordon,” Malcolm said. “Spread out in a circle and keep people away.”</p>
      <p>The group spread out. Diane watched as some last-minute checks were made. Twenty feet from the structure, she was in the dark of night, focused on the steel pieces.</p>
      <p>“Here we go,” Malcolm yelled. The construction lights went out, the darkness fell.</p>
      <p>As Diane watched, she could hear a slight hissing sound. Small flames, equally spaced along the figures, popped into being. Where crude steel once was, graceful silhouettes now glowed.</p>
      <p>“Phase 2,” Malcolm’s voice carried out from the darkness.</p>
      <p>More flames, flowing within the figures, shunted through various pipes and orifices, gave them movement. Small metal reflectors and crystals, cunningly placed, turned the fire and light.</p>
      <p>“Ohhh. Ooooh.” Sounds came from Diane’s lips and from the darkness around her.</p>
      <p>“Phase 3.”</p>
      <p>Within the chests of the sculptures, glowing fires started to build. A hissing, whirring sound built to a roar until they both erupted, spewing fire toward each other. A metal piece between their chests—a single metal rose—started to glow.</p>
      <p><em>Wow</em>, Diane thought. <em>Just wow</em>.</p>
      <p>The rose hung in the air as the fires all started to shut down. Diane could hear cheers and cries from the other people around the structure. She joined them.</p>
      <p>“Man, that was awesome!” Jeremy said.</p>
      <p>“Congratulations, Malcolm,” Steven said. “Three years to get that together?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, about,” Malcolm said. He turned to face Diane as she walked up. “What do you think?”</p>
      <p>“It was extraordinary and beautiful,” Diane said. “Stunning, just stunning.”</p>
      <p>Malcolm hugged her.</p>
      <p>“I’m glad you were here,” Malcolm said, then turned back to the group. “A few more adjustments and then we should be good. Will I see you at the party tomorrow, Steven?”</p>
      <p>“You bet,” Steven replied. “Dead Presidents blowout tomorrow night.”</p>
      <p>“We will keep watch over the piece all night tonight in shifts, then through the day. Should be able to slip away by then,” Malcolm said.</p>
      <p>The groups waved their goodbyes. The Dead Presidents mounted their bikes and headed off on the dark playa, back toward the lights of the city. Diane kept the blinking lights of Steven in front of her, to not get lost.</p>
      <p>“Hey, you,” TK said, pedaling beside her. She was grinning.</p>
      <p>“Hey,” Diane replied, smiling herself.</p>
      <p>“Like the art?”</p>
      <p>“Well, yes,” Diane said. “It was amazing.”</p>
      <p>“You’re humming and smiling.”</p>
      <p>“Am I?” Diane replied. “Race you to the Esplanade.”</p>
      <p>Diane stood on her pedals and began furiously pumping, speeding into the night, passing Steven, heading for the light. Her crew—that’s how she thought of them now—were shouting and cheering behind her. Diane took a bearing on the nearest lamppost, speeding toward where the first camps were being built. She slammed on her brakes, panting and laughing, as TK and Sequoia stopped beside her.</p>
      <p>“God, I have to pee,” Sequoia said.</p>
      <p>“Me too,” Diane replied.</p>
      <p>“Follow the blue lights, should be two streets up. This is five o’clock,” TK said, then pedaled up the road.</p>
      <p>Diane noticed that the spaces around them, which had been empty plots on her previous night’s ride, were filling up or already full. The group passed shapes, towers, and what appeared to be buildings taking shape. People moved in the glow of work lights, lanterns, and headlamps bobbing through camps. Voices, music, and laughter came from the darkness.</p>
      <p>“Oh, thank God!” Sequoia said, pulling up to a row of portos.</p>
      <p>“I’ll watch your bike,” TK said. “Go ahead.”</p>
      <p>Sequoia jumped off his bike and scurried to the porto. He returned soon, and TK and Diane walked to other portos.</p>
      <p>“Be sure you check the seat and floor before you sit,” TK said before disappearing.</p>
      <p>Diane went into her porto and fumbled with her headlamp.</p>
      <p>“Shit,” she said, trying to figure out all the straps she would need to undo just to pee.</p>
      <p>“What’s up?” Sequoia’s voice came from outside.</p>
      <p>“Woman stuff. I need light&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.”</p>
      <p>“Here,” Sequoia said.</p>
      <p>Diane could hear something on the top of the porto. The interior was suddenly illuminated enough so she could see. Sequoia must be pressing his flashlight against the roof.</p>
      <p>“Thanks!” Diane said, looking around. The space was pretty clean, it even had a roll of paper. Undoing enough of her stuff to do her business, she was done in a flash. She buckled up enough to move and came out.</p>
      <p>“Sanitizer at the end,” TK said.</p>
      <p>Diane walked over, got a squirt on her hands, and headed to the bikes. Mounting up, she followed TK’s and Sequoia’s lights. The streets were very dark, and she was a bit confused as to where she was.</p>
      <p>“Where’s Jeremy? Did we lose him?” Diane asked.</p>
      <p>“It happens,” Sequoia said. “It happens a lot when more people are here. That’s why you have to carry all your own stuff. What’s the camp location, Diane?”</p>
      <p>“Three-thirty and E,” Diane replied.</p>
      <p>“Right. Don’t forget. It’s on your tags on your stuff, right?”</p>
      <p>“Like the bike?”</p>
      <p>“Anything you might lose and would want to see again, such as bike, coat, bags, belt, water bottles.”</p>
      <p>“People will bring that stuff back?”</p>
      <p>“Yeah, or to the Lost and Found,” TK said, pedaling. “But no name or camp, no return.”</p>
      <p>“Here we are,” Sequoia said, gliding into the camp.</p>
      <p>The bar was lit up, people were milling about, music was playing. Diane dropped off her bike and stuff, then went over to take a seat at the bar.</p>
      <p>“What can I get you?” Twinkle asked with a smile from behind the bar.</p>
      <p>“Whiskey, I guess,” Diane said. “What’s good?”</p>
      <p>“Try this. See if you like it,” Twinkle said, pouring a trickle into Diane’s cup.</p>
      <p>Diane tasted the liquid. It was smoky and sweet. She nodded. Twinkle added a healthy slug to her cup, then moved off.</p>
      <p>“Enjoy your day, dear?”</p>
      <p>Diane turned and saw Sheba standing behind her. Her hair was swept up onto the top of her head. She was wearing a dark silk dress that flowed and clung at the same time. The glow of the chandeliers and lamps in the bar cast a subdued glow over her.</p>
      <p>“Got a light?” Sheba asked, indicating her cigarette.</p>
      <p>“Got another?” Diane asked, pulling out a lighter.</p>
      <p>Sheba took the proffered light, cupping Diane’s wrist to steady it, and inhaled. She then pulled a pack from the top of her boot and offered Diane a cigarette. Diane took the cigarette and lit it. Sheba sat down beside her.</p>
      <p>“I understand I may have taken you aback today with my forwardness. I apologize if I made you feel in any way uncomfortable.”</p>
      <p>Diane shook her head, surprised.</p>
      <p>“Don’t answer, darling, I can see it in your face,” Sheba said, touching her arm. “Was your cap set toward Jeremy? Did I intrude on your plans?”</p>
      <p>Diane was taken off guard by the direct question.</p>
      <p>“I&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.” Diane began.</p>
      <p>“Again,” Sheba said, “I can see it in your face. Do not worry. <em>Nous avons eu une bonne baise</em>, nothing more. He is very gentle, that one.”</p>
      <p>“You did what?” Diane asked, not understanding the French phrase.</p>
      <p>“It matters not. We shall now be good friends. What do you think so far of”—Sheba gestured with the cigarette—“of all this?”</p>
      <p>“It’s a lot,” Diane replied. “A lot to take in.”</p>
      <p>Sheba laughed, tapped her ash into an ashtray.</p>
      <p>“Tell me more,” Sheba said, leaning close.</p>
      <p>“I saw artwork tonight like nothing I’ve ever seen. Fire and steel&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. and&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.”</p>
      <p>“And what?” Sheba leaned closer, searching Diane’s face. “Hmmm, something else?”</p>
      <p>“Well,” Diane said, dropping her eyes. “There was—”</p>
      <p>“A man?” Sheba asked, her blue eyes sparkling. “A woman? Which? I demand you tell me now.”</p>
      <p>“An artist.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, delicious,” Sheba said, chuckling. “A wispy-limbed Adonis, painting gauze on ripe breasts?”</p>
      <p>Diane laughed. After only a few minutes, she felt completely comfortable with this unusual woman.</p>
      <p>“No,” Diane said definitively. “He is definitely masculine, working in fire and steel.”</p>
      <p>“Hmmm,” Sheba said, taking a drink from her cup. “And you want this man? Sexually?”</p>
      <p>“I—I—” Diane stammered.</p>
      <p>“Wait,” Sheba said. “We are dry.”</p>
      <p>With this, Sheba bounced down from her barstool, turned, and clambered up onto her knees, reaching over the bar and filling two cups. Diane was surprised to see that when Sheba’s dress rose up, her ass was revealed, with no underwear in sight. A wolf whistle sounded from the darkness. Sheba turned, waved to the darkness, and sat back down.</p>
      <p>“Now, you want this man, yes?” Sheba asked, handing Diane the almost-full cup. “Tell me, and more importantly, tell yourself truly.”</p>
      <p>Diane took a drink from the cup and considered, then shared a deeper thought than she normally would have dared.</p>
      <p>“Yes, more than anything right now,” Diane said. “I can’t explain it.”</p>
      <p>“Yes,” Sheba said. “Now the truth comes out. You must go to him. Take him.”</p>
      <p>“I&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.” Diane started. “It’s kind of late. What time&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.”</p>
      <p>Sheba grabbed Diane by her neck, looked deep into her eyes.</p>
      <p>“The time is now. Your time is now!” Sheba said intensely.</p>
      <p>“What if he is gone? What—”</p>
      <p>“No think, only do. Now drink with me, my friend, and live.”</p>
      <p>Sheba drank, raising Diane’s cup with her other hand and pressing it to Diane’s lips. Diane gulped, choking down the whiskey, finishing the cup, breathing heavily.</p>
      <p>“Okay,” Diane said, gasping. “I got this.”</p>
      <p>“Good,” Sheba said, taking Diane by the shoulders, pulling her to her feet, and turning her around. “Remember, a kiss is not a contract, and tonight is not tomorrow. Live <em>now</em>.”</p>
      <p>With that, Sheba smacked Diane on the ass, propelling her forward, and walked with her to her carport.</p>
      <p>“Gather your things,” Sheba said.</p>
      <p>TK wandered up to them.</p>
      <p>“Where are you going?” TK asked.</p>
      <p>“She goes to live,” Sheba said, “to taste life, to experience passion and truth.”</p>
      <p>“A dinner party?” TK asked.</p>
      <p>“An artist,” Sheba said, reaching into a pouch at her belt and handing something to Diane.</p>
      <p>“Condoms?” Diane asked, staring at the packages.</p>
      <p>“Of course,” Sheba said. “We live as adults, not children. You have enough now, your goggles, your mask, shemagh. Water.” Sheba reached into the cooler on the ground. “Here are some beers. Now go. You have all you need. You have the most important thing.”</p>
      <p>“Her vagina?” TK asked.</p>
      <p>Sheba turned to TK.</p>
      <p>“Her soul,” Sheba said dramatically, then turned to look Diane in the eyes. “Her soul.”</p>
      <p>“Make me proud,” TK said.</p>
