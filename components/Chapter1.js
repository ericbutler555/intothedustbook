      <h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
      <p style={{ textIndent: "0" }}>
        <strong>Diane Easting glared at her computer in frustration.</strong> She pushed her tinted glasses up to her forehead to keep her auburn hair from her face. Numbers, spreadsheets, customer complaints, and interdepartmental friction all seemed to land in her lap, the myriad problems of corporate structures and decisions, each of which seemed to require being done three times.
      </p>
      <p>Rising from the sleek modern desk, she picked up her tumbler of tea and walked to the floor-to-ceiling windows that looked out on the city. Midafternoon sunshine warmed her face as she regarded her reflection. At forty-two, she was fit, accomplished, beautiful and, if she was honest, a bit bored.</p>
      <p>Diane observed the street far below and the coffee shop where she had met Daniel, now her former boyfriend. A four-year relationship had started from a chance meeting and ended, though amicably enough, when it had run its course.</p>
      <p>A chirp from her phone brought her out of her musings. Walking to her desk and glancing at the phone, she saw a text from her friend Stacy. Smiling as she picked up the device, she pressed the call button without reading the message.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a change,&rdquo; Stacy said. &ldquo;Since when do you return calls?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;How have you been, my friend?&rdquo; Diane asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Busy as usual. Working to pay to play.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Stacy was her closest friend from college, her artistic lifestyle as diametrically opposed to Diane&rsquo;s as could be. She was a talented artist who eked out a living designing and making incredible artwork, while Diane had followed the corporate route. They had been inseparable in their school years. Stacy was a reckless and passionate wind into Diane&rsquo;s structured and calculated life. Diane was the stable touchstone to Stacy&rsquo;s sometimes chaotic existence.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Same as always?&rdquo; Diane asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Bleh,&rdquo; Stacy said. &ldquo;Anyway, what are you doing for the next two weeks?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Working, running&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Running the world, I&rsquo;m sure. Disregard that. Come play with me.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane smiled, a common reaction to her friend&rsquo;s adventurous spirit.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t just&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You can just hush and come with me. It&rsquo;s been forever. You need to play,&rdquo; Stacy said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;And what, just asking from a place of curiosity, would that mean?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Two words,&rdquo; Stacy replied, then paused. She was always one for the dramatic.</p>
      <p>Diane waited, letting the moment linger, buying time.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m listening,&rdquo; she said, breaking the silence.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Burning Man,&rdquo; Stacy said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Burning Man,&rdquo; Diane replied.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Burning Man,&rdquo; Stacy repeated.</p>
      <p>Diane recalled the various stories Stacy had described over the years as well as the articles she herself had read, the pictures she had seen.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;In the desert somewhere? Dirty hippies getting high in the desert?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Some hippies, yes, nice ones. Desert, yes. Getting high? Hmmm, you never know.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Not interested,&rdquo; Diane said, taking a sip of tea.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I know you better than that,&rdquo; Stacy said. &ldquo;Besides, I bought you a ticket. You have to go.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too old. I don&rsquo;t want to run around with a bunch of kids.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Most Burning Man attendees are over thirty,&rdquo; Stacy said.</p>
      <p>Diane considered this information. If Stacy, who for all her talent had always struggled with money, had bought her a ticket, then it was a big deal.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t really know anything about Burning Man. Stacy, I appreciate the&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. Too busy, what will I do, how, and all that. Let me ask you this, Diane, my dear, a straightforward question. Are you happy?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Well&hellip;&rdquo; Diane hesitated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing well at work and—&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Fucking boring!&rdquo; Stacy&rsquo;s voice said through the phone. &ldquo;Did I ask you how work was going, what money you have, or what fucking spin class you are into? Are&hellip; you&hellip; happy?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane wanted to respond yes, to blow off this ridiculous conversation with her beloved yet crazy friend, but the words didn&rsquo;t come.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Uh-huh. Your silence says volumes. So why don&rsquo;t you think it over and let me know by Monday? Buh-bye,&rdquo; Stacy said as she abruptly ended the call.</p>
      <p>Diane took the phone from her ear and placed it on the desk, staring out the window as she considered. It was ridiculous. Just drop everything and take off? Not likely. Noticing her clock, Diane gathered her ledger book to take notes, walked down the hall to a meeting room, and took her seat at a long wooden table.</p>
      <p>The meeting played out in its usual efficient fashion. Stella Worth, the CEO and Diane&rsquo;s mentor, kept a brisk pace, with little tolerance for unproductive people or cross talk.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Diane? Do you have any input on this item?&rdquo; Stella asked.</p>
      <p>Diane looked up to see Stella staring with steel-gray eyes and a bemused look on her tanned, lean face. Diane could tell Stella knew she&rsquo;d caught Diane daydreaming. Thankfully, they had enough of a history that a gentle nudge was all that was needed, even though Stella was putting her on the spot.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I think Stephan covered the quarterly finances well,&rdquo; Diane replied.</p>
      <p>Diane nodded at her lead team member, who she knew had been grinding on the figures for a week. She was glad for the chance to praise him in the public setting of the meeting and, more importantly, with Stella.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;What about on page seven, paragraph six? Capital outflows concerning South America and the refunds of monies from equipment returns and chargebacks? Have those funds actually settled, or are they in flux at the moment?&rdquo; Stella asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The monies have settled as of eight o&rsquo;clock this morning. Stephan and I reviewed the banking transfers with our Zurich and Singapore accounts to release an accurate quarterly report,&rdquo; Diane said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Good. That&rsquo;s a wrap, then. Back to work,&rdquo; Stella said, closing her record book and the meeting. &ldquo;Diane, meet me in my office in five, if you could.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane nodded and spoke briefly with her team, congratulating them on the presentation. Walking to Stella&rsquo;s office, she wondered what was up. It wasn&rsquo;t like Diane to drift off in a meeting, and she doubted a dressing-down would occur even though Stella was well known for taking subordinates to task for inattention during meetings.</p>
      <p>Diane nodded to the two assistants in Stella&rsquo;s office lobby, both sharp-dressed young men.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Go in, Ms. Easting,&rdquo; the taller of the two said with a smile.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Darrell, close the door,&rdquo; Stella&rsquo;s voice came from within the office.</p>
      <p>Diane walked into the large office, which had an even more impressive view of the city than her own. Stella was sitting with her knees crossed on the modern leather sofa in the sitting area.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Sit, sit,&rdquo; Stella said, patting the couch beside her. &ldquo;Would you like anything? Coffee?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m fine,&rdquo; Diane said. &ldquo;Is this about the meeting?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;The meeting?&rdquo; Stella said with a mock smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous. Just keeping you on your toes. What&rsquo;s on your mind? A new beau?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane grinned. &ldquo;Nothing as exciting as that. A suggestion from a friend.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Do tell.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing, really&hellip;&rdquo; Diane said.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Come on, now,&rdquo; Stella replied, her gaze steady.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;A friend from college,&rdquo; Diane said. &ldquo;She invited me to this festival coming up. It&rsquo;s a ridiculous idea, really.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Is it Burning Man?&rdquo; Stella asked, catching Diane off guard.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Well, yes it is, actually,&rdquo; Diane replied.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Hmmm,&rdquo; Stella said, then got up and walked to the window, looking out.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t going,&rdquo; Diane said. &ldquo;It was just a thought.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Your friend Stacy painted that picture,&rdquo; Stella said, pointing at the large oil painting prominently displayed on the wall behind Diane.</p>
      <p>Diane turned and looked at the painting. One side was an image of a young woman in dark blues and black shadows, reaching out to her mirror image in bold, bright colors and radiant hues on the other side. Stacy&rsquo;s talent was apparent in the beautiful painting. She had expressed so many emotions with oils upon canvas.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s her work. And yes, Stacy is the one who invited me.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Both women regarded the figure in the painting.</p>
      <p>Stella abruptly broke the silence. &ldquo;Is Stephan ready to take more responsibility?&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane took a moment to consider Stella&rsquo;s question. Stephan led her team and had done so for the past year. He was ambitious, hardworking, and smart. Diane also knew that the next step for him to take was the step she was already standing on.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yes or no?&rdquo; Stella asked flatly.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Yes, he is ready to be given more responsibility to season him. Do you have plans for him?&rdquo; Diane asked.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I have plans for you, my dear.&rdquo; Stella turned and regarded Diane. &ldquo;You need to prepare for your next step, and that involves raising someone else.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Diane replied, excited but unsure of what that might mean.</p>
      <p>Stella walked back to the window and looked out with her arms crossed, tapping her chin with the forefinger of her right hand. Diane waited and watched, knowing Stella was rolling scenarios, outcomes, and options through her formidable mind.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what I want you to do,&rdquo; Stella said finally. &ldquo;Take the next two weeks and go to the Burn.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure when it&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I am very aware of when the Burn is as well as what it is,&rdquo; Stella said, turning to Diane. &ldquo;You need to go—away, I mean. I want to throw Stephan into the deep end of the pool and see whether he can swim. And you need a break, as well as other things. Pack up and leave. Don&rsquo;t tell your team where you are going or when you&rsquo;ll be back. The quarterlies are done, and if you have prepared your team as well as I think you have, you taking a few weeks off shouldn&rsquo;t be an issue.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane stood stunned. She certainly hadn&rsquo;t expected this turn of events. At the same time, she realized with some amusement that Stella had done the exact same thing to her once. Thrown her into the deep end to see whether she could swim. She had.</p>
      <p>Stella observed her protégé with a bemused expression. &ldquo;Go have fun. Don&rsquo;t worry about this place. I&rsquo;m jealous. You only get to be a Virgin Burner once.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Well, okay then,&rdquo; Diane said, shaking her head.</p>
      <p>Stella walked over to a curio cabinet in the corner. Diane knew the knickknacks there were memories of Stella&rsquo;s past, but Stella had never shared what memories the objects represented. Stella unlocked a small drawer and withdrew an item.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; Stella said. &ldquo;Here, take this.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Turning around, she handed Diane a leather belt with pouches, buckles, and hooks. A patina of dust, worked deep into the creases, covered the worn brown leather.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been?&rdquo; Diane asked, looking at the belt in her hand.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never tell,&rdquo; Stella said, smiling mysteriously. &ldquo;Now go.&rdquo;</p>
      <p>Diane looked at Stella in a new light. Despite all the years they had worked together, she didn&rsquo;t know that much about Stella&rsquo;s past. The wily CEO held her cards very close to the vest. Diane accepted the belt, shrugged, and walked to the door.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;One more thing, Diane,&rdquo; Stella said.</p>
      <p>Diane looked back.</p>
      <p>&ldquo;Fuck your Burn.&rdquo;</p>
